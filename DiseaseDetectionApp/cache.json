  "wiki_Smoker's Lung": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive lung disease characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. GOLD defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, sputum production or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.\nThe main symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath and a cough, which may or may not produce mucus.",

The disease is characterized by fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and multiple nodules (measuring 2\u20135 centimetres (1\u20132 in) in diameter) on the skin and mucous membranes, including those of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Infected cattle may also develop edematous swelling in their limbs and exhibit lameness.",

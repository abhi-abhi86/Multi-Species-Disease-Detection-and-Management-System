    "description": "Represents a healthy, disease-free potato leaf. This indicates the plant is growing under optimal conditions, free from pathogens and pests, and has access to adequate light, water, and nutrients necessary for vigorous growth and tuber development.",
    "image_url": "conditions/plant/healthy/images/potato_healthy.jpg",
    "stages": {
        "visual_indicators": "Leaves are a uniform, vibrant green color. The leaf structure is fully expanded, turgid (firm), and shows no signs of spots, lesions, discoloration, or puckering. Stems are sturdy and growth is robust.",
        "plant_vigor": "The plant exhibits strong, active growth, including the production of new leaves at the terminal. It is proceeding normally through its growth stages (vegetative growth, flowering, and tuberization) without visible stress."
    },
    "causes": "This is a healthy state, not a disease. It is 'caused' by providing optimal growing conditions.",
    "risk_factors": "N/A. This section is replaced by 'Key Requirements for Health'.",
    "key_requirements_for_health": {
        "sunlight": "Requires full sun (6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day) for optimal photosynthesis and tuber development.",
        "soil": "Prefers well-drained, loose, fertile soil (sandy loam is ideal) with a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0).",
        "watering": "Needs consistent and deep watering, especially during tuber formation. The soil should be kept evenly moist but not saturated. About 1-2 inches of water per week is standard.",
        "temperature": "A cool-season crop. Prefers soil temperatures between 15-21°C (60-70°F) for best tuber growth. High temperatures (above 27°C / 80°F) can inhibit tuber formation.",
        "nutrients": "Requires a balanced supply of nutrients, particularly potassium and phosphorus for tuber development, along with adequate nitrogen for foliage growth."
    },
    "preventive_measures": "N/A. This section is replaced by 'Best Practices for Maintenance'.",
    "best_practices_for_maintenance": "Use certified disease-free seed potatoes to avoid introducing pathogens. Practice 'hilling'—piling soil up around the base of the plant—to protect developing tubers from sunlight (which causes greening) and pests. Ensure good air circulation with proper spacing. Rotate crops (3-4 year rotation) to prevent soil-borne disease buildup. Monitor regularly for pests like the Colorado potato beetle.",
    "solution": "N/A. The 'solution' is to maintain the best practices to keep the plant in this healthy state.",

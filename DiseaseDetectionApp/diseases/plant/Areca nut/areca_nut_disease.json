    "name": "Koleroga",
    "description": "Koleroga, or Fruit Rot, is a severe fungal disease affecting areca nut bunches, primarily during the heavy rainfall of the monsoon season. It leads to the rotting of nuts and can cause complete crop loss if not managed.",
    "image_url": "diseases/plant/Areca nut/images/Areca nut.jpeg",
    "stages": {
        "Initial": "Water-soaked spots appear on one or more nuts in a bunch. The infection is localized.",
        "Advanced": "The entire bunch becomes infected, turns black, and completely rots. Heavy nut drop occurs, leading to total loss of the affected bunch."
    },
    "causes": "The disease is caused by the oomycete (water mold) pathogen Phytophthora arecae. The pathogen thrives and spreads through rainwater splash during periods of high humidity and continuous rainfall.",
    "risk_factors": "Continuous and heavy rainfall during the South-West monsoon. High humidity (>90%) and moderate temperatures. Poor drainage in the plantation. Overcrowded gardens with poor air circulation. Presence of infected debris from the previous season.",
    "preventive_measures": "Practice field sanitation by removing and destroying all fallen nuts and infected bunches after harvest. Ensure proper drainage in the garden to avoid waterlogging. Before the onset of the monsoon, spray the bunches with 1% Bordeaux mixture as a prophylactic measure. Cover healthy bunches with protective polythene sleeves or areca leaf caps ('Kotte') to shield them from rain.",
    "solution": "Spray the bunches with 1% Bordeaux mixture or other recommended copper-based fungicides. The first spray should be applied just before the monsoon begins. A second or third spray may be necessary at 40-day intervals if the rain persists. Remove and burn any infected bunches as soon as they are noticed to prevent the spread of the disease."

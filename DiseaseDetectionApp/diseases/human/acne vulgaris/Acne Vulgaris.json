  "stages": {
    "mild": "Characterized mainly by comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) with a few scattered papules and pustules (inflamed pimples).",
    "moderate_to_severe": "Involves a greater number of inflamed papules and pustules. Deeper, painful nodules and cysts may be present, as suggested in the image, which carries a much higher risk of causing permanent scarring."
  },
  "causes": "Acne is caused by a combination of four main factors: excess sebum (oil) production, hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells, proliferation of the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes, and inflammation.",
  "risk_factors": "Hormonal fluctuations (especially during puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy), a family history of acne, stress, certain medications (like corticosteroids), and potentially high-glycemic diets or certain dairy products in some individuals.",
  "preventive_measures": "While not always fully preventable, management includes washing the face gently twice a day, using non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) skincare and makeup, avoiding picking or squeezing lesions, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",
  "solution": "Treatment depends on severity. Mild acne can be managed with over-the-counter topical treatments containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Moderate to severe acne often requires prescription treatments from a dermatologist, which can include topical retinoids, topical or oral antibiotics, hormonal therapies for females, or oral isotretinoin for severe, persistent cases."

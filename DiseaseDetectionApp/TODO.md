# UI Improvement and Bug Fix Plan

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update apply_theme method: Refine Light and Dark themes with medical-appropriate calming colors (soft blues, whites, grays), better fonts (Arial), and improved spacing.
- [x] Enhance create_domain_tab layout: Increase margins and spacing, adjust grid layouts for better flow, make elements more prominent with rounded corners and professional styling.
- [x] Improve diagnosis result display: Update HTML formatting in on_diagnosis_complete for better readability, add styling for sections (e.g., color-coded confidence, solution), handle missing data gracefully.
- [x] Enhance image display: Add error handling for missing reference images, ensure proper resizing, add borders and backgrounds to QLabel for reference images.
- [x] Update CustomDropLabel and button styles: Apply modern, medical-themed styling with calming colors, hover effects, and better fonts.
- [x] Test the updated UI: Run the app, check diagnosis results, image loading, and HTML display in results.

## 🧪 Technical Implementation Details

### Machine Learning Models

The application uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as the base architecture. This approach offers:

- **Efficiency:** Fast inference on low-powered devices
- **Accuracy:** 92-97% classification accuracy across disease categories
- **Adaptability:** Fine-tuning for new disease classes with minimal data

The model training process includes:

1. **Data Collection:** Curated images from medical repositories and verified sources
2. **Augmentation:** Random crops, rotations, color shifts, and transforms to increase dataset size
3. **Preprocessing:** Normalization, resizing, and tensor conversion
4. **Training Pipeline:** PyTorch implementation with Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduling
5. **Validation:** K-fold cross-validation to ensure generalizability
6. **Export:** Optimized model conversion for deployment

### NLP for Symptom Analysis

The text-based diagnosis uses a hybrid approach:

- TF-IDF vectorization of symptom descriptions
- Medical-specific vocabulary enhancement
- Cosine similarity matching against known disease profiles
- Contextual weighting of medical terms

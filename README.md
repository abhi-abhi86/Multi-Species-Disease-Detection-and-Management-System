## 🧭 How It Works: Process Flow

1. **Initialization:**  
   - Launch `main.py` to start the app.  
   - Loads disease data and the AI model (`disease_model.pt`). Warns if model files are missing.

2. **User Input:**  
   - Use the UI to upload an image or enter symptoms.  
   - Choose the species domain (Plant, Human, Animal) and click "Diagnose".

3. **Background Processing:**  
   - Diagnosis runs in a background thread (`worker.py`) for a smooth UI.  
   - **If image:** AI model predicts the disease.
   - **If symptoms:** Fuzzy string match finds the closest disease entry.

4. **Data Aggregation:**  
   - Fetches full disease info from the database.  
   - Calls Wikipedia and PubMed integrations for summaries and research.

5. **Results Display:**  
   - UI presents all findings: disease info, confidence, Wikipedia, research abstracts.

6. **Report Generation (Optional):**  
   - Generate a detailed PDF with all results and images via the "Save Report" feature.

This modular structure ensures that the UI, core logic, and data are all separated, making the system easier to maintain and expand.

    - [Instructions here](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (see original file for details).

5. **Prepare the Image Dataset**
    - Organize training images in `DiseaseDetectionApp/dataset/` as:
      ```
      dataset/
        ├── disease_one/
        │   ├── img1.jpg
        └── disease_two/
            ├── img2.jpg
      ```

6. **Train the AI Model**
    ```sh
    python DiseaseDetectionApp/train_disease_classifier.py
    ```

7. **Run the Application**
    ```sh
    python DiseaseDetectionApp/main.py
    ```
